Credit where credit is due: This tool is based on CrackMapExec and was originally created by bytebleeder and maintained by mpgn over the years, shout out to them! With the retirement of mpgn, we ([@zblurx](https://twitter.com/\_zblurx), [@Marshall](https://twitter.com/MJHallenbeck) and [@NeffIsBack](https://twitter.com/al3x\_n3ff)) decided to maintain the tool NetExec, formerly known as CrackMapExec, as a completely free open source tool.
